# CM2014_Simu

This repo contains the code for group 18 for the KTH course CM2014 VT24 Simulation Methods in Medical Engineering.

## About the Code

This course is divided into many parts to form a general idea of different simulation methods in Medical Engineering. Coding is needed in some of the labs.

### Math

Math part of the course is about the theory of numerical methods of ODE, including IVP and BVP. Matlab is used to solve the questions in the 2 labs.

## Honor Code

If there is same questions or labs in the future, it is the responsibility of KTH students not to copy or modify these codes, or TeX files because it is against the Honor Code. The owner of this repository dosen't take any commitment for other's faults.
